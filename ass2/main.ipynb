When I used sigmoid activation, my nework would always converge in a really weird way that I can't really explain: it would converge to the mean values of the train data (approx. +- 63), and would be either positive or negative depending on the sign of the label (eg. if yhat = -0.1, a=-63, and if yhat = 100, a=63). I suspect that this is because using sigmoid in the hidden layer makes it difficult to represent the numerical values of the input.

When I used functions that could accomodate for negative values (tanh, leaky relu, etc), it would also do better."]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["7a.
